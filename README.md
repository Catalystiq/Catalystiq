# Hello
## My name is @Catalystiq

I make cool things. I’m currently interested in Web Development, Full-Stack Applications,  Machine Learning, and Discord Bots. I am also currently learning javascript, typescript, html, css, and various libraries and frameworks for them such as react, next, node, express, and others. I am also working on some smaller projects for school and future endeavors. My current project is Catalystiq/Colors
